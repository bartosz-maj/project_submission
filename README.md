# project_submission

The files in this repository are the code for the MSc Project in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Due to their non-deterministic nature the models in the topic modelling and stance classifier training and application notebooks will not produce the same outcome as those seen in the paper. The purpose of these files is to illustrate how those models were made, rather than replicate the exact models. Portions of the noteoboks are commented out. These portions of code uploaded data to the HuggingFace platform. They are commented out to show how the process was carried out, without overwriting the final data that is currently on the platform. 

The comments csv can be obtained under the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavellexyr/the-reddit-climate-change-dataset 

Furthermore, the dataset which was used to train the stance classifier can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edqian/twitter-climate-change-sentiment-dataset
